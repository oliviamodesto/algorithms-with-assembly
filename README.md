# algorithms-with-assembly

Implementing various well-known algorithms in assembly language for the x86 processors.

These algorithms are based on the material presented in the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by T. H. Cormen, C. E. Leiserson, R. L. Rivest, C. Stein.

These programs use the procedures provided by the Irvine32 library (in particular, the one related to the book "Assembly Language for the x86 Processors" by K. R. Irvine,  6th edition).
